# Godot 2D Roadmap

# Phase 1: Fundamentals

## Part 1: Introduction to Godot

### Goals:
- Get used to the engine.
- Gain experience by building a simple game.

### Lessons:
- [Introduction to Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html) - Godot Docs
- [Step by Step Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html) - Godot Docs
- [Your First 2D-Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) - Godot Docs
- [Best Practices](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html) - Godot Docs
- [Version Control](https://youtu.be/tRZGeaHPoaw?feature=shared) - Kevin Stratvert YT

### Assignments:
- Watch a couple of devlogs to have a subtle idea of how people build their games. You can also try to build a really simple game. Remember: YouTube, Discord, and the docs are your friends.

### Resources:
- [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)  
  - This is the reference you will be going to rely on whenever you feel stuck on a certain topic.
  - Always rely on the documentation before anything else. If you need help on a certain topic, you can watch videos on the topic on YouTube or ask fellow Godot users on the Godot Discord server.

## Part 2: Gaining Experience & Familiarity

### Goals:
- Get used to the editor.
- Learn more about programming and GDScript.
- Understand the process of creating a complete game.
- Apply your knowledge to build simple games.

### Lessons:
- [Interactive Godot Editor Tour](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/godot-tours-101/) - GDQuest
- [Editor Introduction](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/index.html#editor-s-interface) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: This does not replace and is not replaced by the GDQuest lesson. You should follow both lessons._
- [Learn GDScript From Zero](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/learn-gdscript-from-zero/) - GDQuest
- [Create a full 2D Game](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/first-2d-game-godot-4/) - GDQuest

### Assignments:
- Use your newfound experience to build a simple game or two. Make sure to apply everything you have learned so far, push frequently to GitHub, and make a habit out of using the documentation.

## Part 3: Maths, Physics, and UI

### Lessons:
- [Vector Maths](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/vector_math.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: If you're comfortable with maths, feel free to check the other lessons in the maths documentation._
- [Physics](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/index.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: Ignore these parts:_
  - Ragdoll system
  - Using softbody
  - Collision shapes (3D)
- [2D Movement](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/2d_movement.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: This is an application of the vectors and physics lessons._
- [UI Basics](https://youtu.be/1_OFJLyqlXI?feature=shared) - Godotneers YT
- [UI Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/index.html) - Godot Docs
- Inventory System Videos [Part 1](https://youtu.be/X3J0fSodKgs?feature=shared) & [Part 2](https://youtu.be/fyRcR6C5H2g?feature=shared) - DevWorm YT  
  _Note: Only watch these after finishing the Godotneers video and UI documentation. Code along._

### Assignments:
- Again, build two games that use your new knowledge. Make sure to put an emphasis on physics and UI.

### Resources:
- [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)  
  _This is a great reference for all the maths topics you will need._

## Part 4: Game Design & Brushing Up

### Goals:
- Tie loose ends such as viewports, tilemaps, and importing assets.
- Learn to organize your projects.
- Learn to organize your code with an intro to design patterns.
- Learn to use debuggers.

### Lessons:
- [Godot Components](https://youtu.be/W8gYHTjDCic?feature=shared) - Godotneers YT
- [Node Paths](https://youtu.be/KzvkrpA5Y3M?feature=shared) - Godotneers YT
- [Intro to State Machines](https://youtu.be/ow_Lum-Agbs?feature=shared) - Bitlytic YT
- [More on State Machines](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/design-patterns/finite-state-machine/) - GDQuest
- [2D Manual](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/index.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Notes:_
  - You have already finished the "movement" section in the previous part.
  - Under the Rendering section, only follow the 2D sprite animation guides.
  - Put a strong emphasis on the "Tools" section. TileSets/TileMaps are crucial topics.
- [Assets Pipeline](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/index.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: Read only up to the translation section._
- [Debugging](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/debug/debugger_panel.html) - Godot Docs  
  _Note: Now that you've learned a lot of stuff and your projects are becoming more complex, you will NEED to learn debugging properly. Don't skip this part._

### Assignments:
- Build one big final game for this part that makes use of everything you've learned, including:
  - Canvas and Viewport
  - TileSets/TileMaps
  - Importing assets
  - Component-based design
  - FSMs
  - Apply your UI and physics knowledge
